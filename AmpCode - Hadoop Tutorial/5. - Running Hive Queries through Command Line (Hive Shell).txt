Apache Hive is open source data warehouse syyem to run SQL on top of datasets stored in HDFS. Much better since using HiveQL same as other SQL not like MapReduce scripts and automatically converts sql query into series of jobs for execution on a Hadoop cluster.

from ratings r JOIN movies m on r.movie_id = m.movie_id
group by r.movie_id, m.movie_name
order by total_rating DESC;
