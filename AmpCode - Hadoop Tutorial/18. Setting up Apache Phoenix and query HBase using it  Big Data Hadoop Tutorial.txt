Setting up Apache Phoenix and query HBase using it 


where we have started the HBase service and ran Phoenix query engine to submit SQL commands on top of HBase tables. 

We have created HBase table using DDL command and used UPSERT commands to ingest the table and retrieved the data using SELECT.

(If you are using Hadoop 2.5 or earlier then you m will not be available on these Hadoop versions and there is no easy of doing it.)

1. login as root user and go inside phoenix
su root
cd /usr/hdp/current/phoenix-client/bin

2. run sqlline.py file to kickoff phoenix service cmd prompt
python sqlline.py

3. in cmd line, get all the tables
> !tables

4. create table of employees
> CREATE TABLE  IF NOT EXISTS employees(
emp_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
emp_name VARCHAR,
job_title VARCHAR
CONSTRAINT my_pk PRIMARY KEY (emp_id)
);

5. show all the table again to see whether the employee table is created or not
!tables

6. insert data manually
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(101,'Rajesh','Developer');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(102,'John','Accountant');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(103,'Sham','Admin');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(104,'Trisha','CEO');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(105,'Kevin','Librarian');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(106,'Emma','Developer');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(107,'Vinod','Clerk');
UPSERT INTO employees VALUES(108,'Bella','Accountant');

7. select * from employees;
drop tables employees;
!quit
