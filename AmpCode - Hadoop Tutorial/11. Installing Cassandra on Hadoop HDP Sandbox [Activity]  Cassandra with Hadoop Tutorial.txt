Installing Cassandra on Hadoop HDP Sandbox where we have installed the Python version 2.7 and setup the repository to install Cassandra service, then we have started the Cassandra service on our Hortonworks HDP Sandbox and created a KEYSPACE which is a Database for Casandra and created one table in it. 

Below are the commands for installing Cassandra:

If you have Python 2.6 then you have to install 2.7 alongside with previous version with below commands:

su root
yum install scl-utils
yum install centos-release-scl-rh
yum install python27
scl enable python27 bash

If you already have Python 2.7 installed, then start executing below commands (remember to login as a root user to get all the privileges)

1. get inside this dir
cd /etc/yum.repos.d

2. to create datastax.repo file
vi datastax.repo

---------inside vi editor-------(press i to insert and edit)

[datastax]
name = DataStax Repo for Apache Cassandra
baseurl = http://rpm.datastax.com/community
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0

ESC

:wq (to save and quit)----------------------------------

3. cat datastax.repo to check the file data

4. to install cassandra (will take a few minutes while it install required things)
yum install dsc30

5. to start cassandra service 
service cassandra start

6. to launch cassandra command line to run all cassandra query (same like SQL) 
cqlsh (and it will show sqlsh>)

7. create database moviesdata
CREATE KEYSPACE moviesdata WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor':'1'} AND durable_writes = true;

8. create table and to show table created without data inside
USE moviesdata;

CREATE TABLE users (user_id int, age int, gender text, occupation text, zip text, PRIMARY KEY (user_id));

DESCRIBE TABLE users;
