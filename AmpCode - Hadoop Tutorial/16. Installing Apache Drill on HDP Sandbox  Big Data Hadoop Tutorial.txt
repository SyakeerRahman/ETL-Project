installing Apache Drill on HDP Sandbox 

where we have downloaded the .tar file for Drill 1.12.0 version which is suitable for Apache Hive which is preinstalled on our HDP Sandbox 

then we have started the Drill service on the specified port to get access for Drill through the web browser. We have also enabled the MongoDB and Hive services and configured the Apache Hive Metastore URL.


1. get into root user
su root

2.get the required file 
wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/drill/drill-1.12.0/apache-drill-1.12.0.tar.gz

3. open/extract the tar file
tar -xvf apache-drill-1.12.0.tar.gz

4. get into the directory
cd apache-drill-1.12.0

5. 
bin/drillbit.sh start -Ddrill.exec.port=8765

if above doesn't work give this (bin/drillbit.sh start -Ddrill.exec.http.port=8765 )

For setting up hive give in update like:

"hive.metastore.urls": "thrift://localhost:9083"
